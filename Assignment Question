A	ticket	office	has	two	agents	answering	incoming	phone	calls.	In	addition,	a	third	caller	can	
be	 put	 on	HOLD	 until	 one	 of	 the	agents	 becomes	available.	 If	all	 three	 phone	lines	 (both	
agent	lines	plus	the	hold	line)	are	busy,	a	potential	caller	gets	a	busy	signal,	and	is	assumed	
lost.	Suppose	that	the	calls	and	attempted	calls	occur	according	to	a	Poisson	process	of	rate	
30	calls/hour,	that	the	length	of	a	telephone	conversation	is	exponentially	distributed	with	
mean	3	minutes,	and	that	the	agents	work	8	hours	per	day.
